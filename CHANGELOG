## [4.0] - 2018-12-11

Released the first beta version of bitmapist4. Main differences from the
previous version.

- Class-based configuration. To work with a specific storage and to set
  some specific settings, a Bitmapist object is instantiated
  instead of using global SYSTEM

- Support for automatic and explicit expiration for temporary keys
  generated on bit operations, and especially during cohort calculation

- Cohort package rewritten to make more convenient usage with wider range of
  scenarios

- Add support for transactions (wrappers around Redis pipelines)

- Tests run against Redis and Bitmapist-server
