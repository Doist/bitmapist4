  some specific settings, a Bitmapist object is instantiaed
  instead of using global SYSTEM

  generated on bit operations, and especially during cohort calculation

- Cohort package rewritten to make more convenient usage with wider range of
  scenarios

- Tests run against Redis and Bitmapist-server
